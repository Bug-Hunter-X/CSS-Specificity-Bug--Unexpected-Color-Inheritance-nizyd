The following CSS code results in unexpected behavior due to specificity issues:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myElement {
  color: green; 
}
```

The element with the ID `myElement` and the class `myElement` will be rendered with the color `green` instead of the expected `blue` because ID selectors have higher specificity than class selectors.  The `#myElement.myElement` selector, though seemingly redundant, overrides the `#myElement` selector due to its higher specificity which can be unexpected.
