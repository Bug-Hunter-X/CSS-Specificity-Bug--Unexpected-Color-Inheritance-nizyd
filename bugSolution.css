To solve this, we can make sure selectors are properly considered. Here's a modified CSS which prioritizes the intended color:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue !important;
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myElement {
  color: green; 
}
```

Using `!important` can solve this problem, but it can introduce new complexity in the long run.  Other solutions might be to restructure your CSS to remove conflicts. Another alternative would be to refactor your HTML or use a different approach. However, understanding the importance of CSS specificity and how to properly resolve such conflicts is key to writing maintainable and predictable styles.
